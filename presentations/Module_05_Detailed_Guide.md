## TEACHER'S GUIDE: MODULE 5 OVERVIEW

**Module Goal:** This is the first of three capstone projects. It is a summative assessment for Modules 1-4. Students will independently design and build a project using the VESC CAN bus communication skills they have learned. The focus is on applying knowledge creatively.

**Lesson Structure:** This is a workshop-focused day.
- **(5 min) Introduction:** Frame the day as their first opportunity to be a "systems engineer." Introduce the capstone project goal.
- **(10 min) Project Options & Rubric:** Walk through the three project options (Battery Monitor, Performance Analyzer, Safety System) and the custom "Design Your Own" path. Clearly explain the evaluation rubric so they know how they will be graded.
- **(25 min) Development Workshop:** Students work in `05_CAN_Capstone.ipynb` to build their chosen project. Circulate to help them brainstorm, debug, and scope their ideas.
- **(5 min) Wrap-up:** Have students save their work and prepare for a brief demonstration in the next class.

## SLIDE 1: Title Slide
**Visual Design**
- A large, central isometric render of a blueprint with technical drawings.
- On top of the blueprint is a single, glowing Electric Blue (#44B6E5) cube, representing the "core idea" or the project itself.
- Faint isometric grid background.

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** MODULE 5: CAN CAPSTONE
- **SUBTEXT:** Design, Build, Demonstrate

## SLIDE 2: TODAY'S GOAL
**Visual Design**
- An isometric render of a student's hands assembling a project—a combination of the VESC, Pi, and a holographic display showing their custom dashboard.
- The connections and the holographic display are glowing Electric Blue (#44B6E5).

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** YOUR FIRST CUSTOM SYSTEM
- **BODY:**
  - Today, you will become the engineer.
  - You will use everything you have learned about CAN bus telemetry and control to design and build your own unique project.
- **CALLOUT:** "This is not an exercise. This is a project."

## SLIDE 3: Project Options
**Visual Design**
- A grid of three simple, monochromatic icons representing the project ideas.
- **Icon A:** A battery icon with a health graph.
- **Icon B:** A speedometer with a "peak performance" marker.
- **Icon C:** A thermometer with a warning shield.

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** CHOOSE YOUR PATH
- **BODY:**
  - **A. Battery Health Monitor:** Track voltage and energy use to create a smart battery gauge.
  - **B. Performance Analyzer:** Log speed and power to find peak performance metrics.
  - **C. Temperature Safety and Brake Intervention System:** Automatically reduce power if the motor gets too hot.
  - **D. Your Own Idea:** Propose a custom project that meets the requirements.

## SLIDE 4: Evaluation Rubric
**Visual Design**
- A stylized, blueprint-style table showing the five evaluation criteria.
- The "Points" column is highlighted in Electric Blue (#44B6E5).

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** GRADING CRITERIA
- **BODY:**
  - **Functionality (30 pts):** Does the project work as intended without errors?
  - **Code Quality (20 pts):** Is the code clean, commented, and well-structured?
  - **Error Handling (15 pts):** Does it handle edge cases (like a disconnected VESC)?
  - **Creativity (15 pts):** Is the approach original or does it extend beyond the minimum?
  - **Documentation (20 pts):** Is there a clear explanation of how the project works?

## SLIDE 5: Your Turn
**Visual Design**
- An open, empty Jupyter Notebook is shown in isometric 3D, with "CAN Capstone Project" in the header.
- A blinking cursor, glowing in Electric Blue (#44B6E5), waits in the first code cell.

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** BEGIN DEVELOPMENT
- **BODY:**
  - Open `05_CAN_Capstone.ipynb`.
  - Review the project options and rubric.
  - Start building your system.
- **MISSION:** Demonstrate mastery of CAN bus communication.
