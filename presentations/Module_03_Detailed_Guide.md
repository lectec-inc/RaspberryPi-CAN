## SLIDE 2: TODAY'S GOAL
**Visual Design**
- A 3D isometric Jupyter Notebook interface is shown.
- From a code cell, a vibrant, real-time dashboard emerges as a 3D projection.
- The dashboard has color-coded panels (Green for OK, Red for HIGH TEMP) with an Electric Blue (#44B6E5) border.

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** FROM NUMBERS TO INSIGHT
- **BODY:**
  - Today, you will transform raw data into a live, professional dashboard.
  - You will build a system that displays speed, temperature, and voltage with color-coded alerts.
- **CALLOUT:** "In 40 minutes, you will build the instrument panel for your vehicle."

## SLIDE 3: Why Visualize?
**Visual Design**
- A two-panel comparison.
- **Left Panel:** A chaotic stream of black numbers scrolling vertically.
- **Right Panel:** A clean, single line graph (in Electric Blue, #44B6E5) showing the same data, with a clear spike indicating an anomaly.

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** PATTERN RECOGNITION
- **BODY:**
  - The human brain processes images 60,000 times faster than text.
  - **Data Stream:** `45.1, 45.3, 45.2, 75.8, 45.4...` (Hard to spot problems)
  - **Visualization:** Instantly reveals spikes, drops, and trends.

---

## SLIDE 4: Real-Time Updates
**Visual Design**
- An isometric animation sequence (described, not animated on slide).
- 1. A terminal window shows `print("...")`. 2. A new line appears below. 3. The `clear_output()` function is shown, and the entire window flashes and is replaced by a single, updated line of text. The `clear_output()` text itself glows Electric Blue (#44B6E5).

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** THE JUPYTER LOOP
- **BODY:**
  - We will use a `while` loop to continuously fetch data.
  - The `clear_output()` command erases the cell, allowing us to print fresh data in the same spot.
  - `time.sleep()` controls the update speed.
- **JUPYTER TRANSITION:** Section 2 - Live Updates.

## SLIDE 5: Dashboard Design
**Visual Design**
- A blueprint-style layout of a dashboard grid (3x1).
- Each grid cell is labeled: "VOLTAGE", "TEMPERATURE", "SPEED".
- The grid lines are thin and Electric Blue (#44B6E5).

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** INFORMATION HIERARCHY
- **BODY:**
  - What is the most critical information?
    - **Primary:** Safety (Temperature, Voltage)
    - **Secondary:** Performance (Speed, Current)
  - A good dashboard presents key data without clutter.

---

## SLIDE 6: Color Coding
**Visual Design**
- Three simple, colored clay-render blocks in a row.
- Left block is a calm Green. Middle is a cautious Yellow. Right is a vibrant Red.
- An Electric Blue (#44B6E5) arrow flows from Green to Red, labeled "ESCALATION".

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** VISUAL ALERTS
- **BODY:**
  - **GREEN:** Nominal. All systems are healthy.
  - **YELLOW:** Warning. Nearing a safety limit.
  - **RED:** Danger. Exceeding a critical threshold.
- **TECH NOTE:** This reduces cognitive load—no need to read the number if the color tells the story.

## SLIDE 7: HTML in Jupyter
**Visual Design**
- An isometric code block showing Python code: `display(HTML("..."))`.
- From this block, a 3D-rendered, formatted text box emerges, showing stylized text with colors and bolding. The `display(HTML(...))` text glows Electric Blue (#44B6E5).

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** ADVANCED FORMATTING
- **BODY:**
  - Jupyter can render basic HTML.
  - We can use this to create formatted panels, apply colors, and build layouts.
  - It's like a mini web page inside your notebook.
- **JUPYTER TRANSITION:** Section 3 - Color-Coded Dashboard.

---

## SLIDE 8: Time-Series Graphs
**Visual Design**
- A 3D isometric line graph being drawn in real-time.
- The X-axis is "Time" and the Y-axis is "RPM".
- The line itself is a vibrant Electric Blue (#44B6E5).
- The `matplotlib` logo is rendered subtly in the corner in monochromatic style.

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** PLOTTING OVER TIME
- **BODY:**
  - `matplotlib` is the standard for data plotting in Python.
  - We will:
    1.  Collect data points in a list.
    2.  Plot the list to see the trend.
- **APPLICATION:** Perfect for analyzing performance or diagnosing issues.
- **JUPYTER TRANSITION:** Section 4 - Graphing.

## SLIDE 9: Car Dashboard Comparison
**Visual Design**
- Side-by-side comparison.
- **Left:** A real, modern car's digital dashboard (e.g., Audi Virtual Cockpit).
- **Right:** The dashboard we are building in the Jupyter notebook, styled to look similar (using the same layout and color logic).

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** INDUSTRY STANDARD
- **BODY:**
  - The system you are building uses the exact same principles as a real vehicle's instrument cluster.
  - **Data Source:** CAN Bus
  - **Logic:** Thresholds and Warnings
  - **Display:** Real-time updates

## SLIDE 10: Your Turn
**Visual Design**
- Final isometric view of the full skateboard system.
- The Raspberry Pi on top has an Electric Blue (#44B6E5) glow, indicating it's the "brain" processing the visualization.
- A holographic dashboard is projected above the board.

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** BUILD YOUR DASHBOARD
- **BODY:**
  - Complete the exercises in your notebook.
  - Customize your dashboard with new data points and colors.
- **MISSION:** Section 5 - Knowledge Check.
