## TEACHER'S GUIDE: MODULE 10 OVERVIEW

**Module Goal:** This is the second of three capstone projects. Students will independently design and implement a complete project that meaningfully integrates AI camera detection with CAN bus motor telemetry. This project serves as a summative assessment for Modules 1-9.

**Lesson Structure:** This is not a traditional lecture day.
- **(5 min) Introduction:** Briefly present the goal for the day: to build a complete, custom integrated project.
- **(5 min) Project Options:** Walk through the project options to spark ideas.
- **(30 min) Workshop:** Students work independently or in pairs on their chosen project within the `Student_Notebook_10.ipynb`. Circulate to assist, debug, and challenge.
- **(5 min) Wrap-up:** Have students save their work and prepare for potential demonstrations next class if needed.

## SLIDE 1: Title Slide
**Visual Design**
- A large, central isometric render of a blueprint with technical drawings.
- On top of the blueprint is a single, glowing Electric Blue (#44B6E5) cube, representing the "core idea" or the project itself.
- Faint isometric grid background.

## SLIDE 2: TODAY'S GOAL
**Visual Design**
- An isometric render of a student's hands assembling the final project—a combination of the VESC, Pi, and AI camera, all connected.
- The connections between the components are glowing Electric Blue (#44B6E5).

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** YOUR CUSTOM SYSTEM
- **BODY:**
  - Today, you will become the engineer.
  - You will use everything you have learned to design and build your own unique, integrated AI + CAN system.
- **CALLOUT:** "This is not an exercise. This is a project."

## SLIDE 3: Project Options
**Visual Design**
- A grid of three simple, monochromatic icons representing the project ideas.
- **Icon A:** A shield with a car inside (Safety Assistant).
- **Icon B:** A parking cone with proximity lines (Parking Helper).
- **Icon C:** A graph with a magnifying glass (Traffic Monitor).

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** PROJECT OPTIONS
- **BODY:**
  - **A. Autonomous Safety Assistant:** Actively respond to hazards based on speed and detection.
  - **B. Smart Parking Helper:** Use object size to estimate distance and provide audio feedback.
  - **C. Traffic Monitor:** Log and classify objects while correlating with vehicle performance.
  - **D. Your Own Idea:** Propose a custom project that meets the requirements.

## SLIDE 4: Evaluation Rubric
**Visual Design**
- A stylized, blueprint-style table showing the five evaluation criteria.
- The "Points" column is highlighted in Electric Blue (#44B6E5).

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** GRADING CRITERIA
- **TABLE:**
  - **Integration Quality (30 pts):** How well do the AI and CAN systems work together?
  - **Functionality (25 pts):** Does the project work as designed?
  - **Code Quality (15 pts):** Is the code clean, commented, and efficient?
  - **Error Handling (15 pts):** Does it handle edge cases gracefully?
  - **Documentation (15 pts):** Is there a clear explanation of the project?

---

## SLIDE 5: Your Turn
**Visual Design**
- An open, empty Jupyter Notebook is shown in isometric 3D.
- A blinking cursor, glowing in Electric Blue (#44B6E5), waits in the first code cell.

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** BEGIN DEVELOPMENT
- **BODY:**
  - Open `Student_Notebook_10.ipynb`.
  - Review the project options and rubric.
  - Start building.
- **MISSION:** Demonstrate mastery of the complete system.
