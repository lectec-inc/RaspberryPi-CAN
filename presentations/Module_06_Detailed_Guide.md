**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** THE CONFIDENCE INTERPRETER
- **BODY:**
  - Today, you will understand how an AI goes from pixels to a confident decision.
  - You will build a system to filter AI detections, trusting what is real and discarding what is not.

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** RULES VS. LEARNING
- **BODY:**
  - **TRADITIONAL CODE:** You write explicit rules. `If fur == true AND whiskers == true...` (Brittle and impossible to cover all cases).
  - **ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE:** You provide examples, and the AI learns the rules itself.
- **JUPYTER TRANSITION:** Section 2 - AI vs. Traditional Code.

## SLIDE 5: How Humans See
**Visual Design**
- A simple three-step diagram.
- 1. Icon of an eye. 2. An arrow. 3. Icon of a brain.
- The path from eye to brain is a soft, organic line.

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** BIOLOGICAL VISION
- **BODY:**
  - Your eyes capture light (pixels).
  - Your brain, trained since birth, instantly recognizes patterns, shapes, and objects.
  - It's pattern recognition on a massive scale.

---

## SLIDE 6: How AI Sees
**Visual Design**
- A parallel three-step diagram.
- 1. A grid of pixels. 2. An arrow. 3. A structured, blocky neural network.
- The path is a digital, straight line in Electric Blue (#44B6E5).

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** ARTIFICIAL VISION
- **BODY:**
  - The camera captures pixels.
  - The Neural Network processes these pixels, looking for patterns it learned during training.
  - The output is a label and a confidence score.

---

## SLIDE 7: Neural Networks
**Visual Design**
- A simplified, 3D isometric view of a neural network.
- It shows an input layer (a grid of pixels), one hidden layer of "neurons" (glowing spheres), and an output layer (text labels).
- Data flows from left to right, highlighted by Electric Blue (#44B6E5) lines.

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** THE DIGITAL BRAIN
- **BODY:**
  - A neural network is a collection of connected nodes, inspired by the human brain.
  - Each layer learns to recognize progressively more complex features (edges -> shapes -> objects).

---

## SLIDE 8: Training AI
**Visual Design**
- An isometric animation concept.
- Thousands of tiny images (dogs, cats, cars) are shown flowing into a large, central "AI Core" model.
- The AI Core glows brighter with each image it "consumes".

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** LEARNING FROM DATA
- **BODY:**
  - Our AI model was trained on millions of images.
  - It learned to identify patterns by repeatedly being shown a picture and told "This is a car."
  - This is why AI can recognize objects it has never seen before in your classroom.

---

## SLIDE 9: The IMX500 Camera
**Visual Design**
- A beautiful, high-detail isometric clay render of the IMX500 AI camera sensor.
- The chip in the center of the sensor has a powerful Electric Blue (#44B6E5) glow, indicating it's the "brain on board".

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** THE BRAIN ON THE CHIP
- **BODY:**
  - This is not a normal camera.
  - The AI—the neural network—runs directly on the camera sensor itself.
  - This is called **Edge AI**.

---

## SLIDE 10: Edge AI Advantage
**Visual Design**
- Three icons in a row, each with an Electric Blue (#44B6E5) checkmark.
- 1. A stopwatch (Speed). 2. A shield (Privacy). 3. A lightning bolt (Low Power).

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** EDGE AI ADVANTAGE
- **BODY:**
  - **FAST:** No need to send data to the cloud. Decisions are instant.
  - **PRIVATE:** Images never leave the device.
  - **EFFICIENT:** Uses very little power.

## SLIDE 11: Confidence Scores
**Visual Design**
- A horizontal bar, like a loading bar, from 0.0 to 1.0.
- A marker is at the 0.87 position.
- A callout from the marker says "87% Certain". The bar is colored Electric Blue (#44B6E5).

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** THE LANGUAGE OF CERTAINTY
- **BODY:**
  - The AI never says "This is a dog."
  - It says, "I am 87% confident this is a dog."
  - This score, from 0.0 to 1.0, is the AI's measure of certainty.

---

## SLIDE 12: Interpreting Confidence
**Visual Design**
- Three example images with AI outputs.
- 1. A clear photo of a cat. Output: `CAT: 0.98` (High).
- 2. A blurry, distant photo of a cat. Output: `CAT: 0.65` (Medium).
- 3. A picture of a toaster. Output: `CAT: 0.12` (Low/False).

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** TRUST BUT VERIFY
- **BODY:**
  - **High Confidence (0.8+):** Very likely correct.
  - **Medium Confidence (0.5 - 0.8):** Possibly correct, but uncertain.
  - **Low Confidence (< 0.5):** Likely a mistake or "false positive."

---

## SLIDE 13: Why Confidence Matters
**Visual Design**
- An isometric render of a "filter" or "sieve".
- Many detections (represented as small cubes) flow in.
- High-confidence cubes (glowing blue) pass through, while low-confidence cubes (dull grey) are blocked.

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** SIGNAL FROM NOISE
- **BODY:**
  - Without a filter, your system will be flooded with false alarms.
  - By setting a **confidence threshold**, we only act on detections we trust.
- **JUPYTER TRANSITION:** Section 3 - Confidence Scores.

## SLIDE 14: Bounding Boxes
**Visual Design**
- A simple line-art diagram of an object (a cup) on a grid.
- An Electric Blue (#44B6E5) box is drawn around it.
- The corners are labeled with coordinates: (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).

**Text Content**
- **DISPLAY HEADER:** WHERE IS THE OBJECT?
- **BODY:**
  - The AI tells us *what* it sees (label) and *how sure* it is (confidence).
  - The **bounding box** tells us *where* it is.
  - It's a set of coordinates defining a rectangle around the object.
- **JUPYTER TRANSITION:** Section 4 - Bounding Boxes.
