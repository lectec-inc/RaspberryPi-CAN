# MODULE 21
TTC Fundamentals (No-Code Lab)

## Goal
Teach Time-to-Collision (TTC) as a risk metric using live camera detections and VESC speed.

## What Students Do
1. Run prebuilt TTC monitor.
2. Tune TTC warning/critical thresholds.
3. Observe status transitions (SAFE/WARNING/CRITICAL).
4. Explain threshold design choices.

## Instructor Notes
- Emphasize TTC = distance / speed as a conceptual safety metric.
- Students should justify threshold changes with ADAS logic, not code mechanics.
