# MODULE 22
FCW + AEB Policy Lab (No-Code)

## Goal
Apply forward-collision warnings and bounded automatic braking from TTC policy.

## What Students Do
1. Run integrated FCW + AEB loop.
2. Tune warning/critical TTC and brake current/ramp parameters.
3. Observe when braking is triggered and how aggressive it is.
4. Evaluate comfort vs safety tradeoffs.

## Instructor Notes
- Braking should occur only under defined risk states.
- Assess intervention policy quality and reasoning, not code writing.
