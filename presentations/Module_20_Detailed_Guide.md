# MODULE 20
ADAS Foundations (No-Code Lab)

## Goal
Introduce ADAS fundamentals on Lectec hardware: AI camera detections, full detectable object library, confidence gating, RPM-based safety gating, and cooldown behavior.

## What Students Do
1. Start the prebuilt system.
2. Display and review all supported detection labels from the model library.
3. Adjust only labeled parameters:
   - target object label
   - minimum confidence
   - minimum RPM for alerts
4. Observe live feed and warning behavior.
5. Answer ADAS reasoning questions (no coding).

## Instructor Notes
- Keep focus on why object selection, confidence thresholds, RPM gating, and cooldowns matter in real systems.
- Do not assess syntax or code style.
- Validate students can explain false positive/false negative tradeoffs.
- Ensure students can justify why a given object class is or is not safety-critical for a PEV.
