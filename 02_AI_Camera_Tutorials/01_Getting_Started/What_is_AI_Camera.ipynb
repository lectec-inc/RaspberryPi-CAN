    "\n",
    "### 📷 Traditional Camera vs 🧠 AI Camera\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional Camera:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Light → Sensor → Image Data → Storage\n",
    "         \"I captured pixels\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI Camera (IMX500):**\n",

    "| **Traditional Camera** | **AI Camera (IMX500)** |\n",
    "|------------------------|-------------------------|\n",
    "| Captures images | **Understands** what's in images |\n",
    "| Stores pixels | **Identifies** objects, people, vehicles |\n",
    "| Passive recording | **Active analysis** and decision making |\n",
    "| Requires human interpretation | **Provides structured information** |\n",
    "| Post-processing needed | **Real-time intelligence** built-in |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Real-World Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Camera Scenario:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional**: Records everything → Human reviews hours of footage → \"Was there a person at 3:42 AM?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI Camera**: Instantly knows → \"Person detected at 3:42 AM with 94% confidence\" → Automatic alert sent\n",
