## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Hardware Setup
1. Connect Sony IMX500 AI Camera to your Raspberry Pi
2. Connect buzzer to GPIO pin 17 (positive to pin 17, negative to ground)
3. Ensure Pi is running Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) for best performance

### Step 2: Software Setup
```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install required packages
sudo apt install python3-opencv python3-numpy python3-matplotlib
sudo pip3 install jupyter ipywidgets

# Enable camera
sudo raspi-config  # Interface Options -> Camera -> Enable
```

### Step 3: Start Learning
```bash
# Navigate to lessons
cd /home/pi/RaspberryPi-CAN/AI_Camera_IMX500

# Start with Level 1
cd 01_Getting_Started
jupyter notebook Camera_Preview.ipynb
```

## üí° Important Notes for SSH/Headless Use

This course is designed for **headless operation via SSH**:
- All camera displays appear **inline in notebooks**
- No desktop environment required
- Images are displayed directly in Jupyter cells
- Optimized for Pi Zero 2W performance

### Accessing Notebooks via SSH
```bash
# Start Jupyter on Pi (SSH session)
jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888 --no-browser --allow-root

# Then access from your computer's browser:
http://[PI_IP_ADDRESS]:8888
```

## üîí Safety and Best Practices

### Hardware Safety
- Always verify GPIO connections before powering on
- Use appropriate resistors for LEDs and buzzers
- Keep camera lens clean for best AI detection
- Monitor Pi temperature during intensive AI processing

### AI Safety
- Understand AI limitations - it's not 100% accurate
- Always have manual overrides for safety-critical applications
- Test thoroughly before deploying in real scenarios
- Consider edge cases and failure modes

## üìä Performance Optimization for Pi Zero 2W

### Recommended Settings
```python
# Optimal for Pi Zero 2W
resolution = (1280, 720)    # HD instead of Full HD
framerate = 20              # 20fps instead of 30fps
detection_interval = 0.5    # Check every 500ms for multi-sensor apps
```

### Resource Management
- Use Pi OS Lite (not Desktop version)
- Close unnecessary processes
- Monitor CPU temperature
- Consider passive cooling for sustained operation

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Camera Issues
```bash
# Check camera detection
rpicam-hello --list-cameras

# Test basic camera
rpicam-hello -t 5000

# Test AI detection
rpicam-hello -t 5000 --post-process-file /usr/share/rpi-camera-assets/imx500_mobilenet_ssd.json
```

### GPIO Issues
```bash
# Test buzzer
sudo gpioset gpiochip0 17=1  # On
sudo gpioset gpiochip0 17=0  # Off
```

### Performance Issues
- Lower resolution and framerate
- Use Pi OS Lite instead of Desktop
- Add passive cooling
- Check for thermal throttling: `vcgencmd measure_temp`
