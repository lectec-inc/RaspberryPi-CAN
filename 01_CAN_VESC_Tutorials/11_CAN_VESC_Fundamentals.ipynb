    "# VESC Communication - Fundamentals Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This notebook will teach you everything you need to know about **communicating with a VESC** (Vedder Electronic Speed Controller). You'll learn how to read data from the VESC, understand what that data means, and send commands to control the motor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a VESC?\n",
    "\n",
    "A VESC is like the \"brain\" that controls an electric motor. Think of it like this:\n",
    "- **Battery** = Gas tank (stores energy)\n",
    "- **Motor** = Engine (creates motion)\n",
    "- **VESC** = Driver (controls how fast the motor spins)\n",
    "- **Your Computer** = Passenger giving directions to the driver\n",
    "\n",
    "The VESC takes power from the battery and controls how much goes to the motor. But here's the cool part: **we can talk to the VESC!** We can ask it questions like \"How fast is the motor spinning?\" and give it commands like \"Speed up to 50%!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes About This Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "\ud83d\udccb **What You'll See in This Notebook:**\n",
    "- Most readings will show **0** or **None** when the motor isn't moving\n",
    "- **Voltage readings will work** - they show the actual battery voltage\n",
    "- **To see real data:** Manually spin the motor/wheel by hand while running the cells\n",
    "- **Advanced sensors** (ADC, servo, etc.) are not connected to anything, so they'll show 0\n",
    "\n",
    "This is normal! The VESC only has interesting data to report when something is happening. It's like asking \"How fast is the car going?\" when it's parked - the answer is 0 until you start driving!"
