# VESC CAN Library Requirements
# For Raspberry Pi CAN communication with VESC motor controllers

# Core CAN communication library
python-can>=4.0.0

# For better performance on Raspberry Pi
# python-can[socketcan]>=4.0.0  # Uncomment if using socketcan specifically

# Optional: For advanced CAN interface support
# python-can[pcan]>=4.0.0       # For PEAK CAN interfaces
