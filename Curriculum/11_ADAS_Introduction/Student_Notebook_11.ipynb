    "- **Lane Departure Warning (LDW):** Alerts driver when drifting out of a lane.\n",
    "- **Lane Keeping Assist (LKA):** Actively steers to keep the vehicle in the lane.\n",
    "- **Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC):** Maintains speed and a set following distance.\n",
    "- **Blind Spot Detection (BSD):** Warns of vehicles in the driver's blind spot.\n",
    "- **Rear Cross-Traffic Alert:** Warns of approaching vehicles when backing up.\n",

    "- **Level 2 (Partial Automation):** At least two automated systems work together (e.g., ACC + LKA). **The driver must remain fully engaged.** Most modern systems (Tesla Autopilot, Ford BlueCruise) are Level 2.\n",
    "- **Level 3 (Conditional Automation):** The car can drive itself under specific conditions, but the driver must be ready to take back control at any time. The car monitors the driving environment.\n",
    "- **Level 4 (High Automation):** The car can fully drive itself within a limited, mapped area (a 'geofence'). No driver attention is needed within this area. (e.g., Waymo robotaxis in Phoenix).\n",
