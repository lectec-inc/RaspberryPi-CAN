    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "1. Estimate TTC each loop.\n",
    "2. Map TTC to bounded brake parameters (`current_a`, `ramp_time_s`).\n",
    "3. Apply intervention policy only when confidence, speed, and cooldown rules pass.\n",

    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "1. In your detection loop, iterate through *all* detected objects (people, cars, etc.).\n",
    "2. For each object, calculate a 'threat score' based on a formula you design. The score should consider:\n",
    "   - **Time-to-Collision (TTC):** Lower TTC = higher threat.\n",
    "   - **Confidence:** Higher confidence = higher threat.\n",
    "   - **Size (Bounding Box Area):** Larger area (closer object) = higher threat.\n",

    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "1. Train your system to recognize the 'stop sign' label from the COCO dataset.\n",
    "2. Create a 'speed zone' state variable in your code.\n",
    "3. When a stop sign is detected with high confidence, enter the 'speed zone' state.\n",
    "4. While in this state, if the vehicle's RPM is above a certain low threshold (e.g., 500 RPM), issue a continuous, gentle warning beep.\n",
    "5. Exit the 'speed zone' state after a set time (e.g., 10 seconds)."
