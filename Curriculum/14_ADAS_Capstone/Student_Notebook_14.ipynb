    "**Challenge:** The Forward Collision Warning system from Module 13 is purely reactive. It only knows an object's current position. An *enhanced* system would predict where an object is *going*.\n",
    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "1. Track the center point of a detected 'person' over several frames.\n",
    "2. Calculate the object's velocity (change in position over time).\n",
    "3. Predict the object's future position.\n",
    "4. Issue an earlier, 'predictive' warning if the object's predicted path will intersect with your vehicle's path."

    "**Challenge:** A real road has many objects. Your system needs to decide which one is the most immediate threat.\n",
    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "1. In your detection loop, iterate through *all* detected objects (people, cars, etc.).\n",
    "2. For each object, calculate a 'threat score' based on a formula you design. The score should consider:\n",
    "   - **Time-to-Collision (TTC):** Lower TTC = higher threat.\n",
    "   - **Confidence:** Higher confidence = higher threat.\n",
    "   - **Size (Bounding Box Area):** Larger area (closer object) = higher threat.\n",
    "3. Display a dashboard that lists all detected objects, but only issue an alert for the object with the highest threat score."

    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "1. Train your system to recognize the 'stop sign' label from the COCO dataset.\n",
    "2. Create a 'speed zone' state variable in your code.\n",
    "3. When a stop sign is detected with high confidence, enter the 'speed zone' state.\n",
    "4. While in this state, if the vehicle's RPM is above a certain low threshold (e.g., 500 RPM), issue a continuous, gentle warning beep.\n",
    "5. Exit the 'speed zone' state after a set time (e.g., 10 seconds)."

    "- [ ] Must include multi-level alerts or responses (e.g., different beeps for different danger levels).\n",
    "- [ ] Must handle edge cases gracefully (e.g., what happens if no object is detected?).\n",
    "- [ ] Must include a real-time status dashboard that explains what the system is 'thinking'.\n",
    "- [ ] Must include documentation (in markdown cells) explaining your algorithm with a flowchart."
